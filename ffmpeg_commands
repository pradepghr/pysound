## convert
ffmpeg -i eg/video.mp4 -acodec libmp3lame -ab 192k audio.mp3
# -i audio.wav
# This tells ffmpeg that we want it to take audio.wav and process it.
# -acodec mp3
# This tells ffmpeg to use the "mp3" audio codec to create the target file.
# -ab 192k
# This tells ffmpeg to use an audio bitrate of 192 kbit/s. The higher this value, the better the audio quality, but the larger the resulting file. 192 kbit/s is pretty good quality audio.
# audio.mp3
#Dump the encoded audio data into a file called audio.mp3.
